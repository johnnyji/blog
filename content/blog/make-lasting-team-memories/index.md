## Companies are made up of people, and people are made up of memories.

The memories we create with our colleagues are what make our jobs worthwhile. This is the reason why I believe making lasting memories with your team is the best way to build a strong company culture.

Other startups with inevitably try to poach your best talent, and some will offer more money, better perks, or a more prestigious title. But what none of them can offer are the memories that you've created together, and will continue to create in the future.

After all, if money, perks and titles were all that matter, then we'd all be working on Wall Street. What a boring world that would be!

## Vlog your team trips!

The best way I've found to make lasting memories at Distru is to **travel together, and record it on video.** The **record it on video** part is insanely important, and not something that most leaders go through the effort of doing. But it's worth it because:

1. It's a wonderful way to show potential hires what your company culture is like (and showing is always better than telling).
2. It's a great way to show your investors that you're building a strong team that's in it for the long haul.
3. Your team will all revisit it again and again, and that trip's value will compound over time.
4. Your team will share it with their family and loved ones, whom will become hidden advocates for your company!

There is so much benefit of just hitting record, and putting together a last team memory!
