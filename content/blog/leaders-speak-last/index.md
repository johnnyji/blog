In meetings, leaders should often try to speak last. This is because their opinions often carry more weight, and can heavily influence others.

1. This can stifle creativity, as people are less likely to disagree with the leader.
2. This can lead to groupthink, where everyone ends up agreeing with the leader through a domino effect.
3. This can also prevent the leader from understanding the true decision making ability of their team. If you have a team that's poor at decision making, you'll never know if you're always speaking first.

So if you're a leader, try to speak last. It'll give you a good gauge on how your team thinks when you're not in the room, and it'll give them a chance to express their own ideas, some of which might be better than yours.
